# Essential Programming Challenges - Python

---

## Foundational Challenges (Beginner)

1. **Hello, World!**  
   Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to ensure your environment is set up correctly.

2. **Variable Swapping Without a Temp Variable**  
   Use simple arithmetic or XOR to swap two numbers without using a third variable.

3. **Palindrome Checker**  
   Check whether a given string is a palindrome.

4. **Sum of a List Using Recursion**  
   Compute the sum of all elements in a list using recursion instead of loops.

5. **Binary Search**  
   Implement binary search to find an item in a sorted list.

6. **Factorial Using Recursion**  
   Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion to practice function calls and base cases.

7. **Reverse a String**  
   Reverse the characters in a string using iteration or recursion.

8. **Prime Number Checker**  
   Write a program to determine whether a number is prime.

## Intermediate Challenges (Core Algorithms and Data Structures)

9. **Selection Sort**  
   Sort an array by repeatedly selecting the smallest element.

10. **QuickSort**  
    Implement QuickSort, a faster sorting algorithm using recursion and divide-and-conquer.

11. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
    Traverse a graph or tree to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

12. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**  
    Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

13. **Two Sum Problem**  
    Given an array, find two numbers that sum to a specific target using a hash map.

14. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**  
    Use sliding window techniques to solve this popular interview question.

15. **Find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) Using Euclid's Algorithm**  
    Solve this mathematically elegant problem for finding GCD.

16. **Implement a Stack**  
    Build a stack with operations like push, pop, and peek.

17. **Implement a Queue**  
    Create a queue with enqueue and dequeue operations.

18. **File Word Count**  
    Read a file and count the occurrences of each word.

## Usage

This list is meant to help you build a comprehensive understanding of programming concepts and showcase your skills in any language. For each challenge:
1. Create a folder named after the challenge (e.g., `01-hello-world`).
2. Write your solution in the language of your choice.
3. Include a README.md in each folder with:
   - A problem description.
   - An explanation of your approach.
   - Any key learnings.

Happy coding!
